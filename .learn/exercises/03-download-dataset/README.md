# Download the Dataset

In machine learning "datasets" are the data we use for our experiments, we usually feed these datasets to the "models" to test our experiments and see if we are able to predict better.

This project already comes with a Pokemon dataset located in the path: `./.learn/assets/pokemon_data.csv`.

You can open the file manually or by running the following commnad on your terminal: `code ./.learn/assets/pokemon_data.csv`.

After you open the file, you will see something like this:

![Pokemon CSV Preview](../../assets/csv-preview.png)

As you can see, the data is represented in a CSV file where every row is a different pokemon with its own ID, Name, Type, HP, Attack, etc.

Please click `next ->` and mvoe to the next step of the exercise.

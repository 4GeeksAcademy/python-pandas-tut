# `01.2` Pipenv: Package Manager

Before starting any python project is always a good idea to create a new python environment, have isolated python environments prevents bugs and makes your application independent.

We are using pipenv as our package and environment manager.

To create a new environment type the following in your terminal:

```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

Note: do not include the `$` symbol.

## ðŸš¨ Important:

Every time you open a new terminal (a.k.a: command line) you will have to enter into the enviroment again by typing `pipenv shell` again.

## ðŸ’» Compare your output

Read the command line output, it should say that "Lanching subshell...." and no error should be visible.

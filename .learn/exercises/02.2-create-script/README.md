# `02.2` Create your script

Python is a scripting language, meaning that to run python code you don't need to compile, all you have to do is create a file with the `.py` extension and running using `python name_of_file.py`.
Let's create our first python script.

## üìù Instructions


1. Create a new `app.py` file in the root of the project, make sure you are in the root.
Your `app.py` file must be next to the `.gitignore`, `learn.json` or `Pipfile` files.
You can also create the file using the terminal command: `$ touch app.py` and open it by double clicking on the file name or typing `$ code app.py`.

2. Add the code to print "hello world" on the terminal using the `print` function.

```py
print("Hello World")
```

3. Run your python script by typing on the terminal `$ python app.py`.

## üíª Compare your output

After you run the command you should see something like this:

![print file](../../assets/hello.png)

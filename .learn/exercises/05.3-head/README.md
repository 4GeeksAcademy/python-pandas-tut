# File Head and Tail

As you can see from the previous step, pandas makes an effort to display the dataset in the cleanest way posible, easy to read and understand.

But Pandas also offers other methods to simplify data visualization, let's start with the `file.head()` function.

## 📝 Instructions

- Use the data_frame.head function to print just the first **three** rows of the dataset.
- Read the `dataframe.head` [documentation here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html?highlight=head#pandas.DataFrame.head) to learn how to use it.

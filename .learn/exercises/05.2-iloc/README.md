# DataFrame iLoc

The iloc command lets you retrieve any cel in your data_frame, for example to print the cel in the `x-axis: 2` and `y-axis: 4` we would have to type the following:

```python
# Print only item in the Row: 2, Col: 1
# remember index starts at 0
print(data_frame.iloc[2,4])
```

## 📝 Instructions

Print the data_frame row 133 and colum 6 on the screen.

## 💻 Expected output

Output on the terminal should be `35`

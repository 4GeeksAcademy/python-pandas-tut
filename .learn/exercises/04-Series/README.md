# Series

A series is similar to an array or list, it's a one dimentional data structure.

You can create a series like this:

```py
data = pd.Series([1, 94, 85, 31, 23, 8])
```

The result of printing `data` on the terminal will be something like this: 

```shell
0     1
1    94
2    85
3    31
4    23
5     8
dtype: int64
```

## 📝 Instructions

Create a series from this list: `ages = [23,45,7,34,6,63,36,78,54,34]`

## 💻 Expected output

```bash
0    23
1    45
2     7
3    34
4     6
5    63
6    36
7    78
8    54
9    34
dtype: int64
```

# File Head and Tail

As you can see from the previous step, Pandas makes an effort to display the Dataset in the cleanest way posible, easy to read and understand.

But Pandas also offers other methods to simplify data visualization, let's start with the `file.head()` function.

## 📝 Instructions:

1.  Use the `data_frame.head` function to print just the first **three** rows of the Dataset.

## Expected Result:

Your terminal output should look like this:

![print file](../../assets/dataframe-head.png)

## 💡Hint: 

+ Read the `dataframe.head` documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html?highlight=head#pandas.DataFrame.head) to learn how to use it.

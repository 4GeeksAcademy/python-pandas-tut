# `03` Datasets

In Machine Learning "Datasets" are the data we use for our experiments. We usually feed these Datasets to "models" and experiment in different ways, the goal is always to predict something.

Possible datasets based on your objective prediction:

- If we sell shoes, how much shoes do I need in my wharehouse for the next month? A good Dataset will be sales from the past 2 years.

- If we are building a program to diagnost pneumonia, a good Dataset will be 100 x-rays with pneumonia and 100 x-rays without pneumonia.

You have to be creative when creating your datasets, think about all the variables that affect a prediction and try collecting and organizing everthing in one or many Datasets.

This project already comes with a Pokemon dataset located in the path: `./.learn/assets/pokemon_data.csv`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. You can open the file manually or by running the following commnad on your terminal:

```bash
$ code ./.learn/assets/pokemon_data.csv
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ After you open the file, you will see something like this:

![Pokemon CSV Preview](../../assets/csv-preview.png)

As you can see, the data is represented in a CSV file where every row is a different pokemon with its own ID, Name, Type, HP, Attack, etc.

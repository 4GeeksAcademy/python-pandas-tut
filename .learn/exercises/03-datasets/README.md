# `03` Datasets

In Machine Learning, "Datasets" are the data we use for our experiments. We usually feed these Datasets to "models" and experiment in different ways; the goal is always to predict something.

Possible datasets based on your objective prediction:

- If we sell shoes, how many shoes do I need in my warehouse for the next month? A good Dataset would be the sales from the past 2 years.

- If we are building a program to diagnose pneumonia, a good Dataset would be 100 x-rays with pneumonia and 100 x-rays without pneumonia.

You have to be creative when creating your datasets. Think about all the variables that affect a prediction, and try collecting and organizing everything in one or many Datasets.

This project already comes with a Pokemon dataset located in the path: `.learn/assets/pokemon_data.csv`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. You can open the file manually or by running the following command on your terminal:

```bash
$ code .learn/assets/pokemon_data.csv
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ After you open the file, you will see something like this:

![Pokemon CSV Preview](../../assets/csv-preview.png)

As you can see, the data is represented in a CSV file where every row is a different Pokemon with its own ID, Name, Type, HP, Attack, etc.

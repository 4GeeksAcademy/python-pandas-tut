# `02` Installing Pandas

Let's kickoff our environment by installing Pandas.

Over the internet you will find the `pip` command being used to install python packages, we prefer to use [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) as it provides more functionality and avoids future maintance headaches by combining [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [virtual env](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) libraries.

Please type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ pipenv install pandas
```

You should see in your terminal an output like this:

## ðŸš¨ Important:

Remember you have to be inside the evironment shell from now on.

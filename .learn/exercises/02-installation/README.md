# `02` Installing Pandas

Let's start by installing Pandas.

Over the internet you will find the `pip` command being used to install python packages, we prefer to use `pipenv` as it provides more functionality and avoids future maintance headings by combining `pip` with `virtual env` libraries.

Please type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ pipenv install pandas
```

You should see in your terminal an output like this:

## ðŸ’¡ Hint:

- If you cannot type or find your terminal try opening a new terminal form the menu.

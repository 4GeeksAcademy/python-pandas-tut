# `05.4` Dataframe Tail

We can also import the last 3 items if we want, but using the `tail` function.

## 📝 Instructions:
1. Use the same DataFrame variable you used in the previous exercise.
2. Use the `DateFrame.tail` function to print just the last **three** rows of the Dataset.

## Expected Result:

As you can see, the first column that represents the index, now instead of 1,2,3 it has the elements 797,798,799.

# `05.4` DataFrame Tail

We can also get the last 3 items if we want, by using the `tail` function.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use the same DataFrame variable you used in the previous exercise.

2. Use the `DateFrame.tail` function to print only the last **three** rows of the Dataset.

## 💻 Expected Result:

As you can see, the first column that represents the index now, instead of 1, 2, 3 it has the elements 797, 798, 799.
